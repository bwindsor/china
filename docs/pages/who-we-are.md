title: Who We Are
---

**Ben Windsor**: I am 27 and ran with CUOC for four years at university before graduating with a
Maths degree. Since then I have worked in London for one year, then back in Cambridge for another 3.5 years, and now I am back in London again. I am a UKCC L2 orienteering coach, and I have coached on multiple summer tours in Stockholm and Scotland, as well as generally being involved in coaching in the Cambridge area and with the East Midlands Junior squad (which I was part of when I was younger). I've been to China a few times for a couple of weeks each time, so know roughly what to expect whilst we are there.

**Zuzka Strakova**: I am 25 and also ran with CUOC for four years whilst studying Chinese, which
included a year abroad in China, where I founded an orienteering club at the university where I was studying,
and also made the connections with the club in Nanjing who are the organisers at the Chinese end for this trip. After university I spent 3 months in China and 6 months in Spain on internships, and I now work in London. I am from the Czech Republic and have lived in the UK since I was 12, running with BKO and SCJS before university. I can speak Chinese and will be able to communicate with the locals whilst we are there.
