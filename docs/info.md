## What is it?
A Chinese orienteering club called Deer-O – based in Nanjing ([map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Nanjing), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing)) are organising an international youth orienteering camp sponsored by the Chinese Bureau of Sport. Last year orienteers from the UK, Czech Republic, Norway and Sweden were invited, this year there will be more countries. The aim of the camp is to see what orienteering in China is like, to make international friends and to learn a bit about Chinese culture & history. It's not about serious training.

This camp is a self-help opportunity: the programme in Nanjing is organised by Deer-O, not by any UK organisation. The entire trip will be coordinated and supported by Ben Windsor, but the athlete and their family will remain responsible for their own conduct and safety.

## When is it?
19th/20th until 31st October

Departure from Heathrow or Gatwick on Friday 19th in the evening or Saturday 20th in the morning. Return is likely to be Wednesday 31st in the afternoon or evening.

## How many people?
6 athletes from each country, M/W16 or M/W18.

## Location
Nanjing, China

## Costs
Once there, all costs (food, training, accommodation, cultural visits) will be covered by the Chinese Bureau of Sport. Costs of flights and visas are to be met by the athlete.

Here were the rough costs in 2017, it should be similar this year, although flights may vary:
Item | Cost
--- | ---
Flights | £470
[Visa](http://bio.visaforchina.org/LON2_EN/upload/file/20180427/2017-12-06%20updated%20schedule%20of%20fees%20_762oUd.pdf) | £175
Accom/food after the Chinese-funded part finished | £100
Travel insurance | £50
Travel vaccinations ([advice](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations/asia-east/china)) | £50-100
*Total* | *£850-900* 

## Food
We guarantee you'll miss western food by the end of your time in China. The food is very different, but is hugely varied and our Chinese hosts will put a lot of effort into taking us to interesting places to eat - it is part of the experience and you should get enthusiastic about trying things!

If you are a vegetarian who isn't fussy about meat having been on the same plate as your food, or that the same utensils have been used to serve meat and veg, you will be fine. If you are a fussy vegetarian or a vegan, you will find it very difficult to manage. If you have a strong allergy to something such as nut traces it will be impossible to guarantee that food does not have traces of allergens in it.

## Water
Don't drink from the tap. We'll go down to the supermarket and buy large quantities of water to take on the bus each day! Somehow, Chinese orienteers manage to drink very little so don't organise for there to be water. 

## Wildlife
You might see the odd snake. Try not to step on it!

## What to expect
Orienteering in China is less developed than in Europe. A fair amount of the terrain is likely to be parkland,
generally in or close to Nanjing. The parks will generally be quite interesting, with lots of them being semi-forested and having plenty of paths. Last year we also orienteered in an orange orchard, a beautiful bamboo forest, and another slightly less beautiful forest. The terrain won't be up to Scandinavian standards, but it can be challenging will be different to what we are used to.

The main aim of the tour is to get a taste of Chinese orienteering, to meet new friends and to see for yourself
what China is like. The cultural element is very important, so we would especially encourage those who are keen
to see different cultures to come. China has a very rich history, so there will be no shortage of opportunities to
explore a range of monuments from the imperial era. As for the food, it is amazing!

Ben Windsor will be leading the UK group and Zuzka Strakova will be leading the Czech group. The two groups will
either meet at London Heathrow or Shanghai and travel together from there. We will be doing some running but will also be available for coaching during the orienteering sessions, and doing our best to make sure that athletes don’t get lost on the journey and during the trip! Zuzka is almost fluent at speaking Chinese and most of the younger generation of Chinese speak some level of English.

We know the Chinese organisers and some of their athletes, as we went to the 2017 camp in China, and before that we organised four days of training for them in the Czech Republic in 2016. We trust that they will once again organise an impressive programme for us.

As this is organised by a Chinese club, it is not covered under British Orienteering’s insurance and you will need
have appropriate travel insurance, making sure that the policy wording includes orienteering in sporting
activities (some don’t). We recommend [Bupa](https://www.bupa.co.uk/travel-insurance) - they are not the cheapest but they are much more likely to be helpful instead of trying to slither out of paying up if anything happens.

This should overlap with half term for most people, but you will need to take some time out of school. If your school is happy with this then we are sure it will be an enjoyable and educational experience! If you would like to take part in this camp please respond to [Ben Windsor](mailto:captain@drongo.org.uk) by 12th August.

Selections will be made by 19th August, after that we will have to move quickly to book flights and apply for visas.

### What does "the athlete and their family will remain responsible for their own conduct and safety" mean?
It means that taking a group of young people to China is quite a responsibility. They will be expected to behave in an adult way. We will take care of everybody as much as we can and will be with the group for the whole trip. If anything serious happens we will be able to sort out getting to hospital and contacting parents. Hospitals will look after you very well, but it will cost a huge amount (we're talking a minimum of £1000/day), and you'll then need to try to negotiate the refund of that with your insurance company.

It is sad when paperwork stops people from being offered fantastic opportunities - this trip goes on trust, not on qualifications and rules. If parents are not entirely happy with this situation, then you should not attend the trip.


### Is this trip linked to JROS?
No. JROS specifically are not involved with this trip because being in China, with the organisation on the Chinese side being out of our control, we cannot guarantee that we conform to British Orienteering's usual rules, insurance and safety guidelines.

## Who we are

Zuzka has spent over a year in China, speaks the language, and knows how things work there and will be able to communicate with medical staff if their English is not good enough.

Ben has visited China a few times so knows roughly what to expect.
