  <h1>Day 7</h1>
<p><a href="/china/pages/news.html">Back to News</a></p>

<p>Everybody was of course tired in the morning, but once out training all seemed good. This was a really nice bamboo forest with nothing but leaves on the ground in a lot of places. Unfortunately the map was a bit old because they’d built a fairly large reservoir and a few big tracks since the map was made. Still, it was very nice running. A quick stop at the hotel for lunch and we were off again for teapot making.</p>

<p>Bus banter/grafting mainly consisted of the Czechs and ACI expanding each other’s vocabulary in each other’s languages. Unfortunately most of the words cannot be listed here. We made teapots out of clay, but there wasn’t time to put them in a kiln so they are for ornamental use only! On the journey back there was further vocabulary exchange.</p>

<p>We then had a bit of time to pack before the farewell dinner.</p>
