To all sponsors, organisers, coaches and athletes. On behalf of the international athletes, we would like to give our thanks for the opportunity to orienteer in new places, and we have really enjoyed navigating the different terrain. 

Thank you for including us in Chinese life and helping to create unforgettable memories in China. Foods like bat wings, lion's brain and chicken embryo have shown us the big difference between European food and Chinese food. The real challenge was making the dumplings, trying to use chopsticks, but mostly trying the food.

We are proud to have represented the Anglo Celtic Isles, and we are happy to have created international friendships and to have developed some Chinese language skills. Every day has been a great opportunity to see the Chinese culture, such as the Homo Erectus Musuem, the Nanjing Eyes and the Confucius Temple. We have also discovered facts about the local wildlife and met some of it up close. We look forward to the rest of the week and we hope all nations have a safe and exciting trip.

xié xié, thank you.
