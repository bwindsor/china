## Dates
23rd October until 31st October.

More information specific to the 2019 trip will appear here nearer to the time. Meanwhile you can [see the 2018 info]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/2018.html).

The dates should overlap with half term for most people, but you will need to take some time out of school. If your school is happy with this then we are sure it will be an enjoyable and educational experience! If you would like to take part in this camp please complete the [form below](#apply) **by Sunday 14th July**.

Selections will be made by **Sunday 28th July**, after that we will have to move quickly to book flights and apply for visas.
