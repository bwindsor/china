title:  "Travelling out"
---

We all met at Heathrow and flew to Shanghai, changing planes at Beijing. In Beijing we had to give our fingerprints. In Shanghai we had a bit of trouble finding the bus, but once on board we drove 3 hours to Tangshan, a town just outside Nanjing. We played a couple of getting to know each other games on the bus along with the Czech group. The hotel was outrageously nice, with very big rooms and very big baths, and hot springs available although unfortunately we didn't have enough time to use them.
