## What is it?
A Chinese orienteering club called Deer-O – based in Nanjing ([map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Nanjing), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing)) are organising an international youth orienteering camp sponsored by the Chinese Bureau of Sport. Young orienteers from many European countries are invited, including the UK, Czech Republic, Norway and Sweden. The aim of the camp is to see what orienteering in China is like, to make international friends and to learn a bit about Chinese culture & history. It's not about serious training.

This camp is a self-help opportunity: the programme in Nanjing is organised by Deer-O, not by any UK organisation. The entire trip will be coordinated and supported by Ben Windsor, but the athlete and their family will remain responsible for their own conduct and safety.

## How many people?
Maximum of 12 athletes from each country, M/W16 or M/W18, limit of 80 athletes in total.

## Food
We guarantee you'll miss western food by the end of your time in China. The food is very different, but is hugely varied and our Chinese hosts will put a lot of effort into taking us to interesting places to eat - it is part of the experience and you should get enthusiastic about trying things!

If you are a vegetarian who isn't fussy about meat having been on the same plate as your food, or that the same utensils have been used to serve meat and veg, you will be fine. If you are a fussy vegetarian or a vegan, you will find it very difficult to manage. If you have a strong allergy to something such as nut traces it will be impossible to guarantee that food does not have traces of allergens in it.

## Water
Don't drink from the tap. We'll go down to the supermarket and buy large quantities of water to take on the bus each day! Somehow, Chinese orienteers manage to drink very little water.

## Wildlife
You might see the odd snake. Try not to step on it!

## Orienteering
Orienteering in China is less developed than in Europe. A fair amount of the terrain is likely to be parkland,
generally in or close to Nanjing. The parks will generally be quite interesting, with lots of them being semi-forested and having complex path networks. In the past we also orienteered in an orange orchard, a beautiful bamboo forest, as well as some slightly less beautiful forests. The terrain won't be up to Scandinavian standards, but it can be challenging and certainly different to what we are used to.

There will also be some sessions with younger Chinese orienteers (probably aged 10-12), where you will pair up with them and help them round the course. Some of them won't speak a word of English, so get practising your miming skills!

The adults leading the groups from various countries will be doing some running but will also be available for coaching during the orienteering sessions, and we will be doing our best to make sure that athletes don’t get lost on the journey and during the trip!

## Culture
The main aim of the tour is to get a taste of Chinese orienteering, to meet new friends and to see for yourself
what China is like. The cultural element is very important, so we would especially encourage those who are keen to see different cultures to come. China has a very rich history, so there will be no shortage of opportunities to explore a range of monuments from the imperial era. As for the food, it is amazing!

## Language
Zuzka Strakova, who will accompany the Czech group, is pretty fluent at speaking Chinese, and most of the younger generation of Chinese speak some level of English. Communication isn't easy, but you will manage!

## The organisers
Deer-O orienteering club is a club in Nanjing. We know them and some of their athletes from the previous camp in China, and before that we organised four days of training for them in the Czech Republic in 2016 when they visited Europe. We trust that they will once again organise an impressive programme for us!

## Safety
As this is organised by a Chinese club, it is not covered under British Orienteering’s usual policies, safety guidelines, or insurance. The reason we say *"the athlete and their family will remain responsible for their own conduct and safety"* is because taking a group of people to China is quite a responsibility. They will be expected to behave in an adult way. We will take care of everybody as much as we can and will be with the group for the whole trip. If anything serious happens we will be able to sort out getting to hospital and contacting parents. Hospitals will look after you very well, but it will cost a huge amount (we're talking at least £1000/day), and then you'll need to try to negotiate the refund of that with your insurance company.

It is sad when paperwork stops people from being offered fantastic opportunities - this trip goes on trust, not on qualifications and paperwork. If parents are not entirely happy with this situation, then you should not allow your child to attend the trip.
