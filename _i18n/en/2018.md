## Dates
24th until 1st November

This should overlap with half term for most people, but you will need to take some time out of school. If your school is happy with this then we are sure it will be an enjoyable and educational experience! If you would like to take part in this camp please complete the [form below](#apply) **by Thursday 16th August**.

Selections will be made by **Sunday 19th August**, after that we will have to move quickly to book flights and apply for visas.

## Travel
Most likely departure from Heathrow on **Tuesday 23rd in the evening**, returning on **Thursday 1st November in the afternoon**. Depending on flight prices we may fly on Wednesday morning, or from Gatwick instead of Heathrow.

Ben Windsor will be leading the UK group and Zuzka Strakova will be leading the Czech group. The two groups will either meet at London Heathrow or Shanghai and travel together from there.

This programme is provisional and may change at any time before or during the week.
