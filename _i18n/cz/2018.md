## Dates
19th/20th until 31st October

This should overlap with half term for most people, but you will need to take some time out of school. If your school is happy with this then we are sure it will be an enjoyable and educational experience! If you would like to take part in this camp please [complete this form](https://link.to.form) by 12th August.

Selections will be made by 19th August, after that we will have to move quickly to book flights and apply for visas.

## Travel
Departure from Heathrow or Gatwick on Friday 19th in the evening or Saturday 20th in the morning. Return is likely to be Wednesday 31st in the afternoon or evening.

Ben Windsor will be leading the UK group and Zuzka Strakova will be leading the Czech group. The two groups will either meet at London Heathrow or Shanghai and travel together from there.
